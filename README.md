# Word-Ladder
A word ladder is a sequence of words, such that each word in the sequence differs by changing a single character. Ie: boot -> book -> bool -> cool -> pool -> poll. WordLadder.hpp/cpp takes a user's input start and end words, and creates a word ladder out of the user input. Restricted by 4-character words only.
